Let's be honest.

Most people "investing" today are just **guessing really loudly**.

"Bro, I'm all in on this startup that makes AI-powered popsicles for cats."

"Oh cool, I just bought 0.0002 of a Bitcoin at 3AM because a guy on YouTube screamed at me"

It's chaos. It's memes. It's vibes.And it's also why we built
**Ticker** -- to save humanity (and your wallet).

### **What is Ticker?**

**Ticker** is like a gym for your investing brain -- except instead of lifting weights, you're lifting your financial IQ from "confused caveman" to "slightly smarter caveman with a Roth IRA."

You take quick, fun lessons. You build fake portfolios (so your real money stays safe). You get AI opponents who try to beat you (spoiler: some are evil geniuses, others are crypto bros who forgot diversification). You get weekly updates that explain what just happened in the market in actual human language.

It's like if Duolingo and Wall Street had a sarcastic baby.

### **How It Works**

![Image](/imgs/image1.png)You start a course. You learn a bite-sized concept like:

- "What is diversification?"
- "Why YOLO-ing into tech stocks is not a plan"
- "Do bonds even lift, bro?"
Then, you build a portfolio based on that lesson. Not just for fun -- you're
**competing**. Against bots. Against your friends. Against that one dude who still believes Dogecoin is "undervalued."

Each week, your portfolio moves with real market data. You'll either feel like Warren Buffett or like the guy who sold Apple in 2002 to buy Beanie Babies.

Then we give you a beautifully crafted, lovingly judgmental **weekly report**, explaining:

1. What moved your portfolio
1. What news you should care about
1. What terrible decisions you made (and how to fix them)
### **Why AI Opponents?**

Because you need someone to blame when you lose.

But also: to show you different strategies. Some bots are cautious. Some are reckless. One of them only invests in energy drinks and companies with the word "quantum" in them. They're here to teach you through contrast -- and keep you humble.

### **Who Is This For?**

1. Teenagers who want to understand money before the world eats them alive
1. Adults who pretend to understand money but secretly Google "what is ETF" every week
1. Parents who want their kids to learn investing *without* starting a Robinhood account at age 12
1. People who love spreadsheets but also memes
1. You. You, reading this right now.
### **Coming Soon (AKA we're not done being geniuses)**

We're working on:

- A FIRE mode where you try to retire by age 33 by not eating out ever again
- Crisis mode: invest during a simulated market crash while we play dramatic music
- A leaderboard, so you can finally prove you're smarter than your little cousin
- More AI bots with weird personalities, like "BoomerBot" and "InfluencerCoin420"
### **The Bottom Line**

You don't need to become a finance bro. You don't need to read 19 books with beige covers and Warren Buffett's face on them. You just need to

**try, fail, learn, and try again -- without burning your life savings**.

That's why we built Ticker. To help you go from "I have no idea what I'm doing" to "I kind of know what I'm doing and I didn't even cry this time."

Welcome to the future of investing education.
