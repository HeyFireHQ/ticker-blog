Teaching kids about investing doesn't need to be dull.

## **Why Should Kids Learn About Investing? 🧒💡**

Investing isn’t just for Wall Street pros—it’s a life skill.
Kids who learn about investing early:

- Make better money choices later
- Understand risk vs. reward
- Think long-term, not impulsively

It’s not about turning them into stock-pickers.

It’s about giving them confidence with money.

**Enter: fun, interactive investing games.**

---

## **1. Start a Family Fantasy Investment League 🏆**

Use **Ticker** to create a private, risk-free investing game.
Everyone gets a virtual portfolio and competes to grow it by picking real stocks.

Kids can invest in companies they already know—like Disney, Roblox, or LEGO’s parent company.

This keeps it fun _and_ relevant.

✅ Safe (no real money)
✅ Beginner-friendly
✅ Instant engagement

Bonus idea: Make it a weekly ritual and offer fun prizes like "pick next movie night" for the winner.

---

## **2. Turn Brands Into Teaching Moments**

Every time you shop, talk about the company behind the product.

Buying Oreos? That’s **Mondelez**. iPad? **Apple**.
Ask your child:

- What do you think makes this company successful?
- Would you want to “own a piece” of it?

Real-world = real retention.

---

## **3. Try the “Lemonade Stand Investor” Game**

Let kids run a pretend business, then ask them:

- What if someone gave you $5 to help your stand grow?
- How would they earn money back?

Introduce terms like:

- Investor
- Profit
- ROI (Return on Investment)

No spreadsheets required—just imagination.

---

## **4. Use Ticker for Classroom or Homeschool Challenges**

With **Ticker’s Family Games**, you can run small-group challenges in classrooms or learning pods.
Set goals like:

- Best portfolio performance
- Most diversified portfolio
- Best long-term thinker

It’s like **fantasy football**—but for financial literacy.

---

## **5. Create a Savings-Investment Matching Game**

Set up a system where every time your child saves $10, you “invest” $5 in a pretend portfolio.

Let them track the growth weekly using Ticker or paper charts.
This shows the value of **saving AND investing**.

---

## **6. Read Kid-Friendly Money Books Together**

Try these hits:

- _“The Everything Kids’ Money Book”_
- _“One Cent, Two Cents, Old Cent, New Cent” (Dr. Seuss Money Book)_
- _“Investing for Kids” by Dylin Redling_

Pair reading with a **Ticker game** to reinforce what they learn.

---

## **7. Play the "Investor or Consumer?" Game**

Look at household items and ask:

Would you rather spend money to buy this—or invest in the company that makes it?

This builds the investor mindset early. Everything becomes a teachable moment.

---

## **8. Use YouTube Smartly**

Channels like:

- **Two Cents**
- **The Money Guy Show (Teen Edition)**
- **Graham Stephan (family-friendly picks)**

Watch short clips, then start a Ticker game that reflects the concepts—like diversification or long-term investing.

---

## **9. Design a Stock Market Poster Wall**

Print logos of kid-favorite companies. Track their “prices” weekly.

Talk about:

- Why some go up
- Why some dip
- What influences change

Visual learners will thrive here.

---

## **10. Let Them Lead a Family “Investor Meeting”**

Every weekend, let your child:

- Review everyone’s portfolio
- Talk about big winners and losers
- Propose a new stock idea

With **Ticker**, they can run the show—and actually enjoy it.

---
