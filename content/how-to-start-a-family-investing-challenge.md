## **Step-by-Step: How to Start Your Family Investing Challenge 🛠️**

### **1. Set the Ground Rules**

Start by deciding:

- 💰 **Starting balance**: Everyone begins with the same amount (e.g. $10,000 simulated dollars)
- 📆 **Timeframe**: Weekly check-ins? A one-month sprint? A semester-long game?
- 🎯 **Goals**: Is it about highest return? Best diversification? Most creative picks?

### **2. Choose Your Platform**

### **3. Build Your Portfolios**

Encourage everyone to research and pick:

- 🐢 Some long-term plays (e.g., blue chips)
- 🐇 A few wildcards (a startup, a trending brand)

Let younger kids pick brands they know — Roblox, Nike, Disney — and explain why they rise or fall.

### **4. Check In Weekly**

Use a family dinner or Sunday brunch to:

- Review leaderboard
- Talk about surprises or market news
- Celebrate learning moments and smart moves

### **5. Reflect and Restart**

At the end of the challenge:
